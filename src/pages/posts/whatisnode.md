# What is Node.js?

Node is a JavaScript runtime environment, by now it's open source.
It lets you use multiple modules which you can work with for doing different tasks, which can be from working with your SO's features to creating servers.

You can install Node.js from this [link](https://nodejs.org/en). it's completely for free!

I recommend to you installing the LTS versi√≥n, which stands for "Long Time Support" version.
